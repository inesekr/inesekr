Hi there, I'm Inese ðŸ‘‹

Genuinely enthusiastic about lifelong learning, I find great satisfaction in constantly expanding my knowledge base and skillset, and then applying it to create meaningful projects.

- Backend: C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API, Entity Framework, Unit testing
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Bootstrap, React.js
