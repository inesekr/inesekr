Hi there, I'm Inese 👋

💻 During my journey into the world of technology, I've tried both frontend and backend development. Now I'm ready to dive deep into any specialized field that picks my attention because, honestly, everything about IT excites me.
Genuinely enthusiastic about lifelong learning, I find great satisfaction in constantly expanding my knowledge base and skillset, and then applying it to create meaningful projects.

🌟 I'm a developer with a passion for full-stack mastery. I enjoy seeing the big picture in software projects, bridging the gap between frontend and backend. My goal is to create seamless, user-friendly solutions by understanding every layer of the technology stack.

📚 My Tech Stack:
- Backend: C#, ASP.NET Core, Web API, Entity Framework, Unit testing
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Bootstrap, React.js
- Databases: MySQL, MS SQL
- Tools: Git, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code
- Approach: Design Patterns, Clean Code, Agile in project management
